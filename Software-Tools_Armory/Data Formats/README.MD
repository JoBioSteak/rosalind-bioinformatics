Problem:

Given: A collection of n (n≤10) GenBank entry IDs.

Return: The shortest of the strings associated with the IDs in FASTA format.

Reflection:

This one was a real head-scratcher. Not because of the problem's difficulty, beyond learning some new syntax specific BioPython, the logic and algorithm were easy to implement. I am 100% sure that my code is correct but Rosalind still insists that my output is wrong. I'm not sure if it's a format thing, an outdated database thing or maybe I am actually wrong, but I'm still putting this one foward.
