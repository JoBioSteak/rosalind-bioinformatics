Problem:

GenBank is the largest database for molecular biologists with several subdivisions. You can use filters to limit your search and return records which fall into your chose categories.

Given: A genus name, followed by two dates in YYYY/M/D format. 

Return: The number of Nucleotide GenBank entries for the given genus that were published between the dates specified.

Reflection:

Surprised by how easy this was. It helps that Enterz has an extensive documentation so looking up how to phrase my query and the different filters was no trouble at all.
