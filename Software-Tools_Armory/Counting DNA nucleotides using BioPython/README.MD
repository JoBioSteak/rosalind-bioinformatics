Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 bp.

Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) representing the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s.

Reflection:

This is my first time using BioPython. I've heard of it before but never had to use it for anything. Very curious to see its full potential, especially since this first appplication wasn't too diferent from just making an algorithm without using the module.
